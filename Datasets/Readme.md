Two datasets were used in this project, one focusing on global education and literacy rates and another specifically on education in India. The global education and literacy dataset contained information on literacy rates, country, year, socioeconomic status, GDP, average years of education in each country and population share, and other education-related indicators across different countries and regions. The Indian education dataset contained information on education rates and access to basic amenities such as computers, electricity, water, and toilets in different states of India. The data is categorized based on the different levels of education prevalent in India.
